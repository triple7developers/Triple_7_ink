It may also completely fade away within the healing phase or months after.  Many tattoo artists will advise their clients to add a pale blue, pale yellow or pale purple to add another pigment to which the white can grab hold.
                                    White ink is great when used in small areas, like edging out a flower, highlight as an accent to the tattoo or to use for  reflection points on tattoos; meant to show a representation of reflections.   When used in larger areas, they tend to not hold up well and tend to fade out completely within a year or less depending on how much the tattoo is exposed to sun light.</p>

                                <h2>Lettering & Ambigrams</h2>
                                <p class="info-font-style"> The use of lettering and fonts has always been a popular ink choice among clients. With so many different options out there, finding that perfect font is key.  Some are hard to read when written out, so keep that in mind when choosing a font. Use a site that allows you to see your word or quote in the chosen font style to see if it's easily read and clear to the eye.
                                    Also popular are Ambigrams. This is when you can incorporate two words together — a composite in one tattoo.  When read upright it will be 1 word, then when flipped upside down it will read another. Not all words can work with this process.</p>

                                <p class="info-font-style">This style of art has a fresh from the drawing board feel. Using sketch lines to create your tattoo. Nothing is perfect, sometimes lines do not touch or close.</p>

                                <h2>Trash Polka</h2>
                                <p class="info-font-style">This bold style stands out on it's own; with much of the work done in black and grey.  The artist then uses red accents to really make a statement with this piece. Although some artists will use other colors, red is the true color of a Trash Polka style.
                                    The style was introduced in  Wurzburg, Germany at the Buena Vista Tattoo Club by Simone Plaff and Volko Merschky. The style resembles fine art collages; it combines realistic images with smears, smudges, sometimes words, and kinetic designs that generate a chaotic look to the piece. Trash Polka pieces are only done in red or black ink. According to Volko, "This style is a combination of “realism and trash; the nature and the abstract; technology and humanity; past, present, and future."

                                <p class="info-font-style">A Polygon style is any 2-dimensional shape formed with straight lines. Triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, rectangles, and hexagons are all examples of polygons. It's also very close to an abstract style. </p>

                                <p class="info-font-style">Sacred geometry tattoos are spiritual in nature and have a religious significance. It has many motifs, one being the very popular, Flower of Life or another variation, Metatron's Cube (based off the original Flower of Life). The nautilus shell, Ouroborus and Mandala, are also part of this group.
                                    Mathematical patterns, dot-work, beading style accents, and hints of color, are also found in this incredibly detailed and delicate style.

                                <h2>Watercolor</h2>
                                <p class="info-font-style">This colorful style that stays away from black outlines or heavy lines; so there's no distraction from the softness this style creates in a piece. Water color is still considered a new style, it's been around for the last 5-10 years. To do a truly perfect watercolor piece, you need to have some black ink within the base of the tattoo so that the piece will hold up over time. On it's own, the softer colors can tend to fade out or soften a bit too much around the edges, making it harder to see or really show up on the skin.
                                    When completed,  it can resemble a painting more than a tattoo.</p>

                                <p class="info-font-style">Fine line work is something that' s been popping up more often. We consider fine-line work to be a more delicate style, almost feminine, with no room for error.  It's a beautifully simplistic style,  great for those who want a tattoo but may not want to commit to a larger piece.
                                    Keep in mind, these fine line styles do not hold up as well over time. The thinner the line, the less chance you have of keeping it crisp.</p>

            <p>I've loved art my whole life and I love working with people that are as enthusiastic and thoughtful
                about the type of art they're going to get tattooed on them. I'm an a By Appointment only
                shop, meaning I don't take walk-ins for a reason. That reason is because since I don't have to pay the
                operating costs of having a shop open all the time, I can offer prices that are as much as 50% off of
                what
                you would normally pay. Plus, (and this is what I like best) I can offer
                way better customer service. Meaning, I can sit down with you, for as long as it takes until we get
                the design, placement, theme and size that you are comfortable getting on you for the rest of your life
