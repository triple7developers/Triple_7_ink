                        I can guarantee a lifelong addiction to tattoo artwork, I will be more then happy to guide you on your path to tattoo perfection.  Keep in mind when artists make creative suggestions it's for your benefit and that of your new artwork, so really listen to your artist.  When they tell you an area is "not guaranteed" it's because that area has issues with shedding, color loss, loss of design and line blow out, making it impossible to guarantee a good heal.  You may experience these issues within days of your tattoo being done or within the weeks that follow.

                        Portraits, Tribal/Polynesian style, Cover Up & Re Working, Celtic, Writing, Working with Scar Tissue (mastectomy patients, surgery scars, burned skin) Photo Realism, Old School, New School, Family Crests, Horror, Designing Sleeves & Socks, Black & Grey as well as full color. All can easily be done, but if your style isn't listed , then please tell me what you you're looking for. Each artist has a wide & varied range of experience & styles, allowing them to help you design & create your next masterpiece. We do have a large selection of flash designs available, but encourage clients to take the time to find ideas/styles they like so that I can help them create / fine tune their tattoo.

                        If you're unsure of who to book with just let me know your ideas or preferred styles so I can assign the perfect artist to create your artwork.  Each independent artist guarantee's their own work, any touch ups are free from the artist that tattooed you. The only exceptions to this rule are listed under  "Non Guaranteed Locations" which are done "AT YOUR OWN RISK" (see FAQ). If it was self induced damage to the tattoo, then there will be a fee for your touch up.

            <p>I've loved art my whole life and I love working with people that are as enthusiastic and thoughtful
                about the type of art they're going to get tattooed on them. I'm an a By Appointment only
                shop, meaning I don't take walk-ins for a reason. That reason is because since I don't have to pay the
                operating costs of having a shop open all the time, I can offer prices that are as much as 50% off of
                what
                you would normally pay. Plus, (and this is what I like best) I can offer
                way better customer service. Meaning, I can sit down with you, for as long as it takes until we get
                the design, placement, theme and size that you are comfortable getting on you for the rest of your life
